initialize mu, phi and ro in edmonds   [done]

rename phiMap etc [done]

constructor function for VertexAssoc [done]

test augment [done]

merge graph with State [done]

create a universal graph/state object [done]
    Graph
    Mu/Phi/Ro/Scanned
    Logger

build logger and integrate it with algorithm [done]

implement pathToRoot correctly [done]

augment malfunctioning [done]

test Util.isMatching/ Util.unique [done]

test and get algorithm to work on a couple of bipartite graphs [done]

incoparate the Edge we are working on into graph [done]

outsource logging functions from graph to logger [done]

banish logger: we will use trace from now on! [done]

get the algorithm to work on a non-bipartite graph (K3) [done]

fix bug: edges are not sorted, and the algorithm 
fails because of that. 
    Probably not that, rather shrink that doesnt work in general [done]

butterfly [done]

butterfly-extended [done]

make sure the edges in the matching exists in the graph [done]

bug: Maybe.fromJust in pma343
find another matching algorithm and 
test and see if we can reproduce the bug [done]
The bug seems to be with my algorithm

fix bug Maybe.fromJust: Nothing in shrink [done]

outsource debug functionality [done]

check so that the number of vertices and edges are correct in DIMACSPARSER []
